Here is a data analysis project done using kaggle dataset on wholesale advertisements.
Application of Pandas in data cleaning and exploratory analysis
Complex SQL queries written in postgreSQL
Data visualization using tableau 

## What is the data set about?
This project analyzes a wholesale dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contains information about advertising campaigns. The dataset includes 211 entries and 14 columns, covering various metrics such as ad set budget, reach, impressions, cost per result, and campaign performance indicators. The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights into the effectiveness of different ad campaigns, identify trends, and provide actionable recommendations for optimizing future campaigns.

## Why choose this data set?
I chose this dataset because it is relatively small and manageable, making it ideal for conducting a comprehensive analysis using a variety of tools. The dataset allowed me to explore, clean, and derive insights effectively while validating my findings.

For this project, I used Python for basic data exploration, cleaning, and creating additional columns to enhance the dataset. To dive deeper into the data, I utilized SQL to run complex queries and extract meaningful insights. Finally, I created visualizations using Tableau to present the findings in a clear and impactful way

## Key Objectives
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution of key metrics, identify missing values, and explore relationships between variables.

Campaign Performance Analysis: Evaluate the effectiveness of campaigns based on results, cost per result, and amount spent.

Budget Optimization: Analyze the relationship between budget allocation and campaign outcomes.

Content and Campaign Type Insights: Determine which types of content and campaigns yield the best results.
